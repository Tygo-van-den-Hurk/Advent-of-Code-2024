# Advent of Code (2024)
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to share it with others or directly via AoC++.
