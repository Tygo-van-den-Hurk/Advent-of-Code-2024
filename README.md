# Advent of Code (2024)
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other. If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to share it with others or directly via [AoC++](https://adventofcode.com/2024/support).

I am using it to learn [Rust](http://rust-lang.org/). Rust is a fast, memory-safe, and productive programming language that can run on embedded devices, web services, and more. It's quite a hard language to learn so this is my excuse to finally learn the language. It's been going quite well so far, after about 10 challenges I seem to no longer be fighting the language as much anymore. Now I'm mostly struggling because the challenges are getting harder to solve.
